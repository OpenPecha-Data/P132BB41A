Youthfulness Gained in Vajra-like Immortality: Verses of Truth for the Long Life of the Perfect
Masters
by Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa

om ah hung, ku chok gyurmé namnang tsé yi gyal
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ. The supreme body, unchanging, is Vairocana, longevity's king,
sung chok gakmé pema tsé yi dak
The supreme speech, unceasing, is the lotus lord of life,
tuk chok trulmé mikyö tsé tayé
The supreme mind, unerring, is Akṣobhya with life beyond limit,
yönten lhündrub trinlé tokmépa
Together with those of spontaneous qualities and unhindered activity,
ratna karma tsé yi lhatsok nam
The hosts of long-life deities from the ratna and karma families—
lamé kutsé tenpar jingyi lob
Grant your blessings, so that this master's life may be secure!
om amarani dziwentiyé soha
oṃ amāraṇi jīvantaye svāhā

né chok namdak chimé takpé shying
In the supreme place, utterly pure, a realm of deathlessness and eternity,
jikdral sengé tekpé dorjé trir
Is a vajra throne supported by the lions of fearlessness,
tsawé lama orgyen tsepakmé
Upon which the root guru appears in the form of Orgyen of Boundless Life,
ku yi ö kyi khordé tsechü dü
Drawing in the vital nectar of saṃsāra and nirvāna with light from his body—
gyalwa sé dang chepé tsewang kur
May the victorious ones and their heirs grant the long-life empowerment,
jalü dorjé ku ru drubpar shok
So that you gain accomplishment in the rainbow body's indestructible form!
om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi ayukhé hung droom nri dza sarva siddhi pala hung ah
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi āyuṣe hūṃ bhrūṃ ṇrī jaḥ siddhi phala hūṃ āḥ

daknyi palchen dorjé shyönnü ku
I appear in the form of the awesome heruka, Vajrakumāra,
ku lé séchok trulpa drangmé trö
And from my body send out countless Supreme Son emanations,
barché dragek tamché nyurdu dral
Who swiftly liberate all obstacles, enemies and obstructing forces.
lamé ku dra dralwé sönam kyi
Through the merit of liberating all who are hostile to the guru's form,
dak kyang barché dü kyi yul lé gyal
May I too be victorious in the battle over the obstructing maras,
shedrub tenpé gyaltsen drengwar shok
And raise the victory banner for the study and practice of the teachings!
om benza kili kilaya sarva bighanen bam hung pé
oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya sarva vighnān baṃ hūṃ phaṭ

jetsün drolma dün gyi namkhar jön
The noble lady Tārā appears in the sky before me,
utpal palbeü nyima char khé ö
With utpala flower and endless knot, radiant as the rising sun,
dakchak pönlob nam la pokpa yi
And as her light shines on us all, teacher and disciples,
döpé dön nam tamché nyurdu drub
May all our aims and wishes swiftly be fulfilled,
chiwa mepa dorjé sok drub né
And, gaining the indestructible force of deathless life,
sangye tenpa yün ring nepa dang
May we always uphold the teachings of the Buddha,
drowa nam la pendé pelwar shok
As we bring ever greater benefit and happiness to all beings!
om tare tuttare ture sarva arta siddhi siddhi kuru soha
oṃ tāre tuttāre ture sarva artha siddhi siddhi kuru svāhā

This was written for the long life of all supreme guides—those great beings, such as the Red
and Black Hat lords of refuge, who uphold the teachings—and because the Jamgön Lama said
that we, father and son, should have a practice that combines Guru and Kīlaya. More immediately,
I had a wish to write something for the monks to chant, and, when the lord of refuge,
Situ Rinpoche, together with his disciples, created the most wondrous circumstances for
my longevity through the practice of Lamé Tukdrup Yishyin Norbu (“The Guru's Wisdom Mind
Practice: A Wish-Granting Jewel”), I offered this as a long-life practice in response. May
it be beneficial!
